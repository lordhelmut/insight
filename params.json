{"name":"Insight","tagline":"","body":"# *insight*\r\n\r\n*insight* is an open-source bitcoin blockchain explorer with complete REST\r\nand websocket APIs. Insight runs in NodeJS, uses AngularJS for the\r\nfront-end and LevelDB for storage.\r\n\r\nCheck some screenshots and more details at [insight's project homepage](http://insight.bitcore.io).\r\n\r\n*Insight* project is now splitted in two repositories. One for the [API](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api) and for the front-end. This repository is for the front-end, which will install the API as a NPM dependency.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* **Node.js v0.10.x** - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/).\r\n\r\n* **NPM** - Node.js package manager, should be automatically installed when you get node.js.\r\n\r\n## Quick Install\r\n  Check the Prerequisites section above before installing.\r\n\r\n  To install Insight, clone the main repository:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/lordhelmut/insight.git && cd insight\r\n\r\n  Install dependencies:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install\r\n    \r\n  Run the main application:\r\n\r\n    $ npm start\r\n    \r\n  Then open a browser and go to:\r\n\r\n    http://localhost:3001\r\n\r\n  If *insight* reports problems connecting to **bitcoind** please check the CONFIGURATION section of \r\n  [insight-api README](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api/blob/master/README.md). To set the \r\n  environment variables run something like:\r\n  \r\n     $ INSIGHT_NETWORK=livenet BITCOIND_USER=user BITCOIND_PASS=pass INSIGHT_PUBLIC_PATH=public  npm start\r\n\r\n\r\n  Please note that the app will need to sync its internal database\r\n  with the blockchain state, which may take some time. You can check\r\n  sync progress from within the web interface. More details about that process\r\n  on [insight-api README](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api/blob/master/README.md). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nTo run insight locally for development mode:\r\n\r\nInstall bower dependencies:\r\n\r\n```$ bower install```\r\n\r\nTo compile and minify the web application's assets:\r\n\r\n```$ grunt compile```\r\n\r\nThere is a convinent Gruntfile.js for automation during editing the code\r\n\r\n```$ grunt```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn case you are developing *insight* and *insight-api* toghether, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n* Install insight and insight-api on the same path ($IROOT)\r\n```\r\n  $ cd $IROOT/insight\r\n  $ grunt\r\n```\r\nin other terminal:\r\n```\r\n  $ cd $IROOT/insight-api \r\n  $ ln -s ../insight/public\r\n  $ INSIGHT_PUBLIC_PATH=public node insight.js \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```INSIGHT_PUBLIC_PATH=insight/public  grunt```\r\nat insight-api's home path (edit the path according your setup).\r\n\r\n**also** in the insight-api path. (So you will have to grunt process running, one for insight and one for insight-api).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nFor more details about the *insight API* configs and end-point, just go to [insight API github repository](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api) or read the [documentation](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nContributions and suggestions are welcomed at [insight github repository](https://github.com/bitpay/insight).\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
